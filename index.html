            <p>
              Matthew 7:15 NIV - &quot;Watch out for false prophets. They come
              to you in sheep&#39;s clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious
              wolves<br />
              1 John 4:1 NIV - Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but
              test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many
              false prophets have gone out into the world.

                  Subjects: Emmanuel Sola Olowokere aka &ldquo;Agbari&rdquo;
                  &amp; Olajumoke &ldquo;Jumi&rdquo; Awe Olowokere
                </p>

                <p>
                  Blessings brethren, one of the greatest tricks of a predator
                  is to appear very harmless, good, and &ldquo;safe.&rdquo;
                  Think for a moment; how successful could a predator be if they
                  just SHOWED you their true colors and not act like wolves in
                  sheep clothing/trickery?
                </p>

                <p>
                  Case-in-point our subjects of today&rsquo;s sermon, Sola
                  &ldquo;Agbari&rdquo; Olowokere, has done a masterful job of
                  convincing some people he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;man of God&rdquo;
                  who hears from God, lives a holy/righteous/upstanding life.
                  We&rsquo;ll undress just a little of the sheep&rsquo;s
                  clothing today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Straight to the action, time is limited. We have come across a
                  series/catalogue of Agbari&rsquo;s messages (text, WhatApp)
                  and some voice calls ranging from about 2008 to 2022. There
                  are over 90,000 messages alone to get through, so on
                  today&rsquo;s sermon we&rsquo;ll go over just a few we found
                  interesting around the 2010/11/12 time period. Don&rsquo;t
                  worry, once we have time to go through everything we&rsquo;ll
                  share more.

                  with the Awosikas and bro Niyi regarding Funmi and Wole&#39;s
                  involvement in this mess. Since this is a fam (2/3) ily

                  discussion was going on. Anyway, all is well! &#39;Just wanted
                  you to know my feelings on this. (3/3) Thank u sir!&quot; </i

                <br />
                Now notice the talks going on with Niyi and the Awosikas*<br />
                There aren&rsquo;t many issues that go past the ears of Niyi and
                consult of the Awosika&rsquo;s. The difference is that the
                Awosika&rsquo;s act like they don&rsquo;t know (liability sake)
                and Niyi acts like he too-knows, Mr &ldquo;I have all the

                  messages, not including picture messages/WhatsApp
                  Messages/WhatsApp deleted messages. We have spent a month+

                  not even 10% through this first set. One of the quick things
                  we did with the first batch of text messages is to search
                  &ldquo;delete.&rdquo; Why? Because we know a bit of the
                  pastors behavior patterns and how he tell all his (sexual)
                  prey to &ldquo;make sure you delete these o&rdquo; over and
                  over. So we searched the messages and deleted archives : ) Let

                    >&quot;Hi Dad, thanks for your text. I love reading from
                    you. I thououghly enjoyed our conversation last nite,
                    I&#39;m always happy that we can share our feelings plainly,
                    I love that we can do that. I also look forward to spending
                    time with you, we&#39;ve talked so much about what we would
                    like to do with/to/for each other, I can&#39;t help but
                    wonder if it will truly happen. I know that we both want it,
                    I know for a fact that I want to feel you inside me, I want
                    you to make me come multiple times, I want to taste you and
                    oh how I want you to taste me to, and help me come. Are the
                    things I want too much, can I want all these things from you
                    and also want to protect you and us and want us to stop,
                    before we hurt anyone. I guess I don&#39;t know, for now all
                    I can think and remember is that you fit perfectly inside
                    me, like it was made for me, was it? (**smile**) I love you,
                    I love us and I love what we share.<br />

                  <br />
                  Well good-God-almighty! That&rsquo;s refreshing : ) How many
                  of you can honestly say you knew the man of god was this
                  freaky?! Even his wife doesn&rsquo;t. As we read through
                  these, coming from a number in Nigeria (we found out is the

                    &quot;Hi Dad, sorry Tope came in to the room to talk to me.
                    Feyi&#39;s flight was cancelled, so she&#39;s on d next
                    flight to arrive Fri evening, missing d engagement.&quot;
                    &quot;Sucks! I just tried calling u now, went to ur VM. But
                    I&#39;m sure u&#39;re not asleep yet now, I guess I&#39;ll
                    talk to u later. Oh, I remember what other things we were
                    going to talk about in d car, u were asking me if I wanted
                    anything, and I was asking what my options were? Also we
                    were going to talk about how d fasting will affect our
                    discussions. Especially bcos Val&#39;s day is during d same
                    fasting period. I thought about what d what could have been
                    on Val&#39;s day, and d baby boy ( it was a nice thought).
                    Remember d 1st time, and we talked about dancing together,
                    I&#39;d like that , and I&#39;m looking forward to that at d
                    val&#39;s day celebration, I just hope &amp; pray that I
                    don&#39;t get carried away, and forget we&#39;re in a public
                    setting, I think now that I&#39;ve thought abt it, I can
                    caution myself.&quot; </i

                  scripture, hears from God. Then they start to SEE YOU as a
                  god. Interesting way to take advantage of people.

                You&rsquo;ve been &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; to him most of your adult
                life, but what did you think? If you bothered to think. All
                those days you leave her ALONE at church with him, you come back
                to those warm (and sometimes salty) kisses - what did you THINK
                was happening? Oh you thought the demon in him turned off for
                you?<br />
                Ever since you came off the ship you&rsquo;ve been at his mercy,
                before you even uprooted yourself to Minnesota for him.<br />
                Your entire livelihood depends on him.<br />
                You&rsquo;ve never shown you&rsquo;re able to stand on your own
                two feet. So why wouldn&rsquo;t he be banging your wife as he
                feels? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be entitled to her? Or did you
                think he got you that Abuja contract because you&rsquo;re loyal
                or handsome? You&rsquo;re living in upper middle class
                neighborhood and driving Tesla ALL funded by him and you think
                he wont drive your wife? L-O-L We can&rsquo;t wait to see how
                you respond, most likely act like you don&rsquo;t see it,
                that&rsquo;s the coward thing to do. BUT YOU KNOW. And pretty
                soon, your seeds will too. There&rsquo;s no way to remove this
                like you did those written notes on cars back then or keep other
                members trying to confront him from seeing him, Mr Bodyguard.<br />

                <h3>THE SHEEP - PAY ATTENTION TO THESE:</h3>

                <p class="pb-3">
                  Once someone with a little charisma quotes scripture from
                  memory and say &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; over and over almost all of
                  your common sense gets deactivated. Your spirit of discernment
                  just turns off, when the Bible is clear that you need to test
                  all spirits (1 John 4:1), why do you THINK that is? Why did it
                  take this website for you to THINK?<br />
                  1. Your &ldquo;MOG&rdquo; (man of god) avoids all public
                  events, and those he&rsquo;s compelled to &ldquo;show
                  face&rdquo; at, he rushes out. WHY do you think that is? Well,
                  his victims list is growing out of control and some of these
                  women/people are getting very unpredictable. So he thinks if
                  he avoids public events he can avoid confrontation.<br />
                  <br />
                  2. &ldquo;But he prayed with/for me and God answered,
                  he&rsquo;s of God!&rdquo; You think God answered your prayers
                  because of him? No, seriously? Bible is very clear; Romans
                  9:16: So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that
                  runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. God will BE God
                  regardless of man. God &ldquo;answered&rdquo; your prayers in
                  spite of, not because of Olowokere.<br />
                  If he TRULY were &ldquo;God sent,&rdquo; hears from God, man
                  of God etc etc&hellip; Why is it that when he tells you
                  &ldquo;God said we&rsquo;ll be out of Hebron by
                  2019/2020&rdquo; it didn&rsquo;t happen? Or God forgot what he
                  said? Or better yet &ldquo;God said nobody will die this
                  year&rdquo;? Not only did people die, his own ministers and
                  leaders did as well. May their souls rest in peace. What about
                  the Minister who died December 9th and he, along with
                  Awosika&rsquo;s and Kotila, hid it from you all till January
                  the following year? Do you THINK your confidence for all those
                  end of the year &ldquo;sacrificial giving&rdquo; would have
                  been the same had you known one of his own ministers went on
                  to be with the Lord? Don&rsquo;t worry Dr K &amp; Kotila, we
                  won&rsquo;t go into those details yet. Let me guess, you
                  haven&rsquo;t noticed your MOG is not giving you any specifics
                  on what &ldquo;God said&rdquo; anymore? It&rsquo;s just your
                  month of Rain, uplifting, testimony, favor, reward etc.
                  etc.<br />
                  <br />
                  3. How many people have you seen leave that church (but
                  won&rsquo;t say why TO YOU) and God continues to bless them,
                  be with them, lift them, keep them?<br />
                  <br />
                  4. How many of you can ask him a question about an allegation
                  you heard? If you don&rsquo;t get spun around with meetings by
                  Niyi lol it&rsquo;s &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain later / Ehnn
                  Hmmm It would be hard for you to understand / Let&rsquo;s talk
                  about it when I have time.&ldquo; and he&rsquo;ll never have
                  the time lol Deflecting is an art form he thinks he has
                  perfected.<br />

                  no service; it&#39;s &#39;just a space.&#39;&quot; MEANWHILE;
                  He&#39;s twisting all your emotions to go get $25,000-$50,000
                  personal loans and bring it to him for &quot;just a
                  space&quot; that will remain in he and his wife&#39;s name
                  alone.<br />
                  <br />
                  6. Common Sense Isn&rsquo;t Very Common.<br />
                  You have a current space you bought for about $750,000 and
                  recently was evaluated over $2Million. Now, common sense would
                  say if you want another building (while current one
                  isn&rsquo;t even being used to half capacity) that you should
                  sell this one and use the profits to acquire another,
                  right?<br />
                  Well, with the help of one of his small wives, the current
                  building operates as a food shelf, it has beds for homeless
                  people and stuff. All things that the State of Minnesota will
                  compensate you for having and doing. It&rsquo;s a
                  &ldquo;passive&rdquo; cash flow. So, why would he sell that
                  and go start over with another building when he can just tell
                  you mu-mu&rsquo;s &ldquo;God said&hellip;&rdquo; and
                  you&rsquo;ll bring money for him to buy another building?<br />
                  Why do you THINK Jumoke was on stage talking about what she
                  loves about this closing is that they get to keep both
                  properties? Whose names do you think are on the properties?
                  Yours? Lol<br />
                  As some of you have started noticing from the outright cash
                  grab; you&rsquo;re being used for their personal gain. Why
                  else do you think your MOG got into it with James Fadele and
                  got kicked out of Redeem?<br />
                  Oh sorry, shouldn&rsquo;t get into that yet.

                <h3>BOARD OF TRUSTEES</h3>

                <p>
                  Here is a board that has NO IDEA what the pastor does with all
                  the funds, just a bunch of yes men. Who, anywhere, can say
                  factually where all the money collected goes? We want you to
                  speak up before we point out all the reckless spendings of
                  your man of god, the Marriot Ambassador Elite, the (jaw
                  dropping) lavish gifts. Ghandi is coaching your MOG on how to
                  &ldquo;behave&rdquo; in his circles but he gravely
                  underestimates the desperation of greed. Don&rsquo;t worry
                  Ghandi, we&rsquo;re not going to give Access to your
                  &ldquo;personal&rdquo; behaviors yet.<br />
                  For those of you curious to learn more; Search online for
                  &ldquo;Marriot Ambassador Elite&rdquo; and look up the
                  requirements (the monetary requirement change yearly) and you
                  can call their customer service to enquire about the status.
                  Your &ldquo;man of god,&rdquo; who doesn&rsquo;t pastor a
                  church of 300 consistent members, spends more time in hotel
                  rooms than in his own bed with his wife. Marriot Ambassador
                  Elite status is an extremely elite group of big spenders with
                  the hotel chain. The pastor has been Ambassador Elite a few
                  years now. And no, it is not transferable or group use-able.
                  Meaning when he tries to tell you &ldquo;We use it for church
                  guests&rdquo; or &ldquo;other pastors use it&rdquo; &ndash; He
                  is lying. CALL the customer service and ask, it isn&rsquo;t
                  possible. ALL hotel stays must be by him.<br />
                  Or the cars he&rsquo;s buying his little wives, amongst other
                  gifts?!<br />

                <h3>THE &ldquo;LOYAL&rdquo; SUPPORTERS</h3>

                <p>
                  There are some of you still hanging through the years, a lot
                  of you in silence these days. We know he has given you money,
                  paid your rent, bought cake/rice for your birthday, bought
                  furniture for your home, paid the down payment for your
                  business, called you to pray with you during a difficult time,
                  even lied to RCCG on your behalf so you could become a
                  Deacon/Deaconess/Pastor, did one act of kindness or another
                  etc &ndash; We KNOW his game plan. He used SOME of the money
                  he has been taking to do these things so that when a day like
                  today comes his first response will be &ldquo;How can you have
                  something to say, you that &lsquo;I&rsquo; helped
                  with&hellip;&rdquo; This whole time we were thinking he was a
                  man of God and GOD was using him to be a blessing to people,
                  we thought he was doing the Matthew 6:3-4 and not letting even
                  your left hand know what your right is doing? Lol Our question
                  to you &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; supporters/beneficiaries are: Has
                  the act he helped you with AS A PASTOR justify you being quiet
                  about every other thing you hear about him? It makes it all
                  &ldquo;Ok&rdquo; what he is doing to the lives of others? What
                  if these things you act like you don&rsquo;t hear; are done to
                  your children? Your nieces and nephews?<br />
                  Your conscience is that cheap?
                </p>

                <p class="pb-3"></p>

                <h3>WATCH YOUR WIVES</h3>

                <p>
                  Some of you men are, understandably, gullible to this. So,
                  we&rsquo;ll give you some little hints.<br />
                  1. Use of work/alternate phone<br />
                  The pastor will rarely ever talk dirty/nasty with your wife on
                  her main line (unless a desperate event/moment), because
                  &ldquo;What if you or anyone just open the phone and
                  see?&rdquo; He&rsquo;s not stupid. He will use and/or even
                  offer alternate phone line(s) and their work phones to do all
                  the talks. And he constantly tells them to make sure
                  they&rsquo;re deleting everything.<br />
                  <br />
                  2. Dad/Daughter or an acronym. When they&rsquo;re in their
                  talks, he won&rsquo;t mention them by name, just acronym.<br />
                  All that &ldquo;Dad / Daughter&rdquo; you see in the messages,
                  well, if you haven&rsquo;t seen above and you&rsquo;re still
                  fooled by that; your situation only remains for God to
                  intervein.<br />
                  <br />
                  3. Personal gifts she stumbles to explain where they came
                  from.<br />
                  The pastor loves loves loves loves loves to buy them gifts.
                  Pay attention to all subtle things she can&rsquo;t explain
                  where they came from directly like earrings, necklace, watch,
                  perfume, clothes etc. He has a &ldquo;what can I buy you that
                  your husband wont notice&rdquo; thing.<br />
                  <br />
                  4. Locations<br />
                  He meets them at work, even fly to different cities/countries
                  &ldquo;to preach&rdquo; and meet up in hotels; and everywhere
                  else. Trust us, any 10&ndash;30-minute break she can take at
                  work or away from home, they&rsquo;ve planned it out. He meets
                  them at malls, meets them at hotels, meets them in parking
                  lots, he even meets them in the church.<br />
                  His whole disguise is based on &ldquo;No one would ever think
                  I&hellip;&rdquo; &ndash; and does whatever follows that line.

                <h3>THE &ldquo;LITTLE&rdquo; WIVES</h3>

                <p>
                  You&rsquo;re not at all alone. Sola is a sex addict amongst
                  other things. He has, at minimum, 4-8 of you on rotation at
                  any given time. Why do you think he&rsquo;s &ldquo;busy&rdquo;
                  and can have those attitude tantrums he has; then comes back
                  when it&rsquo;s your turn with that classic &ldquo;Na wa
                  o&rdquo; &ndash; Oh, we know : ) He struggles with a lot of
                  demons, same demons that his father (and his children), and
                  his half-brother Segun Olowokere struggle with too.
                  We&rsquo;ll go over all those details later. All those
                  &ldquo;My doctor said my blood pressure is high&rdquo; he
                  slips into sermons every now and then; it&#39;s from the
                  Viagra and tribal medicines he takes like morning vitamins for
                  that little penis he has no control over when he cums inside
                  of you WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION &ndash; Yes, we know! Just an
                  FYI (no factual allegations with this): HIV medications have
                  advanced a lot in the last decade and it&rsquo;s undetectable
                  and said to not be transmittable as long as you take your
                  pills. His wife is a manager at a popular hospital, he knows
                  this very well. But HIV isn&rsquo;t the only thing to worry
                  about when you&rsquo;re dealing with a sex addict. It&#39;s
                  only a matter of time before he gives you a gift that&rsquo;ll
                  stay with you a lifetime.<br />
                  <br />
                  When you say you don&rsquo;t want to do anymore, or he gets an
                  attitude and falls into that classic silence. That &ldquo;What
                  are you going to do? Who will believe you?!&rdquo; silence; we
                  know : ) When you&rsquo;re very much in-between a rock and a
                  harder place. You being a good person, he didn&rsquo;t study
                  and pick you by accident, worry about what will people say?
                  And his children? So you keep quiet. It&rsquo;s all part of
                  his plan. Those &ldquo;children&rdquo; are adults (minus the
                  last one, with Jumi) &ndash; and when did the repercussions of
                  his behavior and how it affects HIS children become your
                  responsibility? You&rsquo;re absolutely not alone, there are
                  several of you. We&rsquo;ve gotten information from several
                  and we have lots of footage/texts/pictures from a lot more
                  that we&rsquo;re shuffling to get through as well, it&rsquo;s
                  only a matter of time.<br />
                  <br />
                  If you&rsquo;re waiting for a divine/God said moment; here it
                  is! VERIFIABLE information that can help stop this behavior
                  and protect others from being victims is what we need. We
                  don&rsquo;t do gossip. If you want your identity to remain

                  Proverbs 9:10 - The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
                  wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.<br />
                  A bit to digest huh? We haven&rsquo;t even gotten to the
                  WhatsApp or the women from 2020/21/22/23. This should probably
                  be a series, right? Don&rsquo;t worry, you have a few hours to
                  try to plan what story you&rsquo;re going to give these people
                  and how you&rsquo;re going to try to spin them. Then
                  we&rsquo;ll respond.<br />
                  <br />
                  We know, you don&rsquo;t fear God. But you&rsquo;ll understand
                  why that scripture is in the bible you memorized but
                  doesn&rsquo;t dwell in your heart soon. Remember, Toun called
                  you and told you about the dream she had (no, we&rsquo;re not
                  going to get into that relationship yet), clearly you
                  didn&rsquo;t take her seriously. She&rsquo;s not the only one
                  who has tried to warn you to change your ways, but you feel
                  you&rsquo;re smarter than everyone, right?<br />
                  God said to tell you: LET-MY-PEOPLE-GO!

                  Possibly the most dangerous person in this environment.<br />
                  How long did you plan on keeping this secret under wraps? Long
                  enough to keep all your worldly possessions, hope those
                  buildings you&rsquo;ve been able to buy are worth it.<br />

                  It&rsquo;s not like men were lined up interested in you! And
                  now you have children and don&rsquo;t want shame. So you allow
                  it to happen to others? You attack victims and stay heartless
                  so your secrets can be safe? What a woman of God after His
                  heart and will!<br />
                  <br />
                  What God told us to tell you is simple: &ldquo;Grab your
                  neighbor and say NEIGHBOOOOR!!!! Every-single-thing (whatever
                  you consider good and otherwise) my husband, Emmanuel Olusola
                  Olowokere has done to all these people who have trusted in him

                  know it&rsquo;s been going on well before Sola was kicked out
                  of The Redeemed Christian Church of God in 2020. We&rsquo;re
                  aware this is common behavior amongst a lot (not all) of you
                  RCCG pastors. We know you have a network of close
                  pastor-friends, and that birds of the same feather...<br />
                  We know a lot about some of you that you wouldn&rsquo;t

                  Pastor, we know you&rsquo;re for the community and the
                  community is for you : )<br />
                  Can&rsquo;t believe that lad got upset after your wife got
                  pregnant with her last child, can you imagine?! The lad was
                  upset that you&rsquo;re still sleeping with your own wife
                  too?<br />
                  Either way, not why we&rsquo;re here, those accounts/numbers
                  you were able to &ldquo;get&rdquo; on those gigs and gave to
                  Olowokere to run them; will need to be ran back. You&rsquo;re
                  not that close, left and came back, and his accomplice for no
                  reason &ndash; We&rsquo;re very aware.<br />

                  Your husband spends a lot of time being &ldquo;busy&rdquo; all
                  over the place, we know, but he&rsquo;s so caught up in being
                  busy that he hasn&rsquo;t stop to think of what his
                  emotionally a child, but in a sixty year old body attention
                  seeking wife has been up to while he&rsquo;s
                  &ldquo;busy,&rdquo; in Ondo or elsewhere, who has been keeping
                  you warm? Better yet, has he even considered why you take so
                  many phone calls and texts messages away from him? : )<br />

                  The Pinnacle pastors, the &ldquo;model&rdquo; working
                  professional church leaders who know/see/hear no evil. Just
                  conveniently turn their backs when known issues arise, go
                  silent and act like their brains forgot how to function. But
                  will still be lobbying (and living) for positions in Abuja and
                  laundering money back and forth for themselves and &ldquo;man
                  of god;&rdquo; oh we know. We know of most of the properties,
                  even the Abuja one you frequent. Most church members see you
                  as the &ldquo;working&rdquo; professionals who
                  &ldquo;believe&rdquo; in the foolishness being sold, but
                  they&rsquo;ll know the truth soon. Kayode is one of THE top
                  mental health professionals in the state of Minnesota, owning
                  several locations of his own mental health practice, Pinnacle
                  Behavioral Healthcare &amp; is highly sought after at M Health
                  Fairview. He has decades of experience with mental health and
                  yet ACTS like he doesn&rsquo;t observe anything going on right
                  under his nose, posting his wife to Abuja for months, and
                  issues people bring to him and he deflects (he thinks he
                  can&rsquo;t be &ldquo;liable&rdquo; if he acts like he
                  doesn&rsquo;t know) and all other things he observes around
                  him that he has been watching for well over fifteen years!
                  He&rsquo;ll even get on stage to coerce the sheep of how
                  &ldquo;we&rdquo; are joint owners in this new building, bring
                  your money! They&rsquo;re not at all as innocent as you
                  imagine. They&rsquo;re part of the scheme of playing with the
                  sheep&rsquo;s minds.
